                <h1>Fighting the Climate Crisis with Robots</h1>
                <p>
                    I think it's fair to say the climate crisis is something that's close to everyone's hearts (If it
                    isn't close to yours, it should be). <!-- A bit condescending -->
                    In recent years, there's been increasing pressure for climate
                    action, and in response there's been an increasing number of climate initiatives involving modern
                    technology. Let's take a look at a few!

                        Most people are aware of the basics: <b>trees are good for the environment.</b> Yes,
                        yes, algae do more work for the atmosphere than trees, blah, blah, blah. Let's focus on
                        'trees good', though: by extension, deforestation bad, and the opposite - 'afforestation' -
                        good. Some initiatives are automating the planting of large quantities of trees.

                        One strategy is using large drones, carrying 'seed ball packs', to distribute the seed balls
                        over a large, remote areas quickly. It's especially effective when it comes to replanting
                        forests damaged by wildfires, particularly in places less easily accessible by conventional
                        vehicles (cars).<br> Interestingly, aside from acorns or seeds, each 'seed ball' also contains
                        <i>chilli</i>; this prevents the seed balls from being eaten by local wildlife!

                        <a href="https://milremrobotics.com/">Milrem Robotics</a> has designed two autonomous forester
                        vehicles, a <a href="https://milremrobotics.com/product/robotic-forester-planter/">planter</a>
                        and a <a href="https://milremrobotics.com/product/robotic-forester-brushcutter/">brushcutter</a>.
                        The planter can carry more than 300 seedlings at once and is capable of planting a hectare of
                        new forest in 5~6 hours, totalling between 1000 and 3500 seedlings in that time. It records and
                        communicates the exact location of each seedling to the brushcutter - which can then remove
                        competing vegetation around the seedlings.

                        Clearly, a substantial quantity of greenhouse gas emissions can be attributed to the wasteful
                        fabrication of products, such as packaging, that end up being household rubbish. As we all
                        probably know, recycling helps to combat this waste by re-using materials, particularly
                        plastic or aluminium, instead of producing more from raw resources.

                            However, recycling poses a problem: since all materials should be processed differently, it must
                            be sorted into different media! This is quite a tricky challenge. Recently, a
                            <a href="https://www.hope.ac.uk/news/allnews/artificial-intelligence-to-revolutionise-recycling.html">team of researchers</a>
                            utilised a <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> fitted with high-resolution
                            camera to differentiate paper, glass, plastic, metal and cardboard. It isn't magic, though; it
                            does this using a neural network algorithm trained on 3,500 unique images of rubbish. Armed with
                            this data, the Pi can control robotic arms to remove these objects from the conveyor and place
                            them into specific receptacles.

                    <h2>Construction</h2>
                    <p>
                        Another sector famous for its effect on the climate is construction. Unsurprisingly, a
                        significant portion of non-agricultural emissions can be attributed to the construction
                        industry. Additionally, popular construction materials such as concrete consume immense
                        quantities of - usually potable - water, which is a shockingly limited resource; only about 3%
                        of Earth's water is freshwater, and only 0.4% of this is accessible! (the rest is locked up
                        in polar ice caps, or deep underground)

                        <p>
                            A research team from Texas A&M University plan to replace concrete with earth local to construction
                            sites. This plan depends on their ability to improve soil's load-bearing capabilities, to which
                            the research lead said they "are making excellent progress". Allegedly, 3D printing enabled a
                            versatility which allowed them to construct entire architectural facades! However, meeting existing
                            building regulations with such structures remains a challenge.
